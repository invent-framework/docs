# On Being Together

We welcome everyone, irrespective of their backgrounds. If you're thinking,
"but they don't mean me", _then we especially mean YOU_.

* If you're from a background which isn't well-represented in most coding
  groups, get involved - _we want to help you make a difference_.
* If you're from a background which **is** well-represented in most coding
  groups, get involved - _we want your help making a difference_.
* If you're worried about not being technical enough, get involved - _your
  fresh perspective will be invaluable_.
* If you need help with anything, get involved - _we welcome questions asked
  in good faith, and will move mountains to help_.
* If you're unsure where to start, get involved - _we have [many ways to
  contribute](/contributing)_.

It means we are a diverse and inclusive community, where freedom of expression
is respected, encouraged and celebrated.

Therefore, you _will_ meet people working with the _Invent_ framework who are
different to yourself.

This is an expression of what you can expect from us and what we hope from you
as we find ourselves "being together" with _Invent_:

<blockquote>
When being together, especially if things go wrong,<br>
we acknowledge and work through differences.<br>
In so doing, we transform and enlarge each other.<br><br>
To nurture our mutual growth,<br><br>
<span class="indent">this is a place of
<span class="indent">learning, understanding, and sharing;</span></span>
<span class="indent">this is a place to
<span class="indent">affirm tolerance and compassion;</span></span>
<span class="indent">this is a place for
<span class="indent">collaborative creativity.</span></span><br>
All the aspects of yourself you choose to bring to this place<br>
are welcome here.<br><br>
Reciprocate! Welcome, embrace and learn from others<br>
(even in the face of apparent hostility or misunderstanding).<br><br>
Thoughtful, careful and courteous contributions are a gift,<br>
and never knowingly diminish, dehumanize, harm or harass others.<br><br>
To act against this spirit invites ostracism,<br>
a loss that diminishes us all.<br><br>
Thank you.
</blockquote>

We (the core maintainers of the _Invent_ project) promise always to seriously
and constructively engage with all parties should problems arise.

Reach out to us, in confidence.

Our focus is context, care and compassion, in a spirit of understanding, hope
and tolerance, to foster a safe, enjoyable and enriching space for
collaboration on the development of the _Invent_ framework.

However, we reserve the right to exclude participants, solely at our
discretion, for bad faith actions and activities that intentionally diminish,
dehumanize, harm or harass people.

If required, we will involve any necessary official authorities to deal with
potentially illegal activity. In all other cases, we take a three step approach
when problems arise:

1. We will respectfully engage with everyone involved and listen very
   carefully. If required, we will address problematic behaviour and ask people
   to modify their actions. We expect everyone involved to act with care,
   compassion and in good faith.
2. If problematic behaviour continues, we will contact those involved and
   explain that any further activity of this kind will result in them being
   temporarily blocked or permanently banned from participating in the
   development of the _Invent_ framework.
3. Despite our warning, if those persons show no sign of changing their
   problematic behaviour, we will be true to our word and temporarily block or
   permanently ban them. Henceforth, no further _Invent_ related interactions
   about the matter will take place with those persons.

[This is a work in progress](https://github.com/ntoll/being_together) and we
welcome [constructive feedback]() given in good faith.
