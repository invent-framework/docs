<h1 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Express yourself with code.</h1>

# What

The _Invent_ framework helps anyone make and share apps.

Deliberately constrained to use a small number of core concepts, _Invent_ 
is **easy to teach and learn**. Combine the core concepts to construct apps
that reflect _your unique vision_ of our digital world. Built in tools help you
playfully imagine, explore and refine your applications. Share your creations
with anyone on the planet at the click of a button.

That's it!

# Why

Computers are everywhere. They touch all aspects of our lives, from our social
interactions to managing the everyday infrastructure of society.

The _Invent_ framework empowers anyone to creatively participate in the world
of computers.

We believe everyone should be able to directly control the technology in their
lives, rather than be directed by complicated code controlled by others. This
is digital emancipation: **you're no longer just a user**, but a _co-creator
and participant_ in computing culture.

What will you invent?

# How

The _Invent_ framework uses two of the most vibrant technical ecosystems on the
planet.

* [The web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) - the world's most
  ubiquitous computing platform, mature and familiar to billions of people.
* [Python](https://python.org/) - one of the world's most popular and easy to
  learn programming languages.

_Invent_ sits on top of [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/), a platform for
Python in web browsers. 

The built in tools guide beginner programmers with their first steps, but stay
out of the way of experienced folk. Our focus is on ease of expression,
flexibility in the face of change, and engaging in a journey to experience.

# Who

_Invent_ is for anyone who wants to express themselves with code.

**We are an open source project** ~ the _Invent_ framework is free to use.

**We focus on our community** ~ we invite you to contribute your unique
perspective, talents and skills to the future of our project. 

**We welcome everyone, irrespective of background** ~ collaborate within a
cosmopolitan community of unique individuals, learn from each other and
mutually enlarge our digital world.

We expect folks participating in the development of the _Invent_ framework to
[engage respectfully, compassionately and in good faith](being_together.md).
